# LLM Plays Wordle

In this project, an LLM plays the game Wordle.
Currently, basic functionality is working, using the ChatGPT API but the model performs poorly. I am working on prompt engineering to improve the model and, in the future, fine-tuning an Open Source LLM.

Disclaimer: using an LLM is not a cost-efficient way of solving Wordle. A decision tree can solve this game optimally.

## Roadmap

### Core features
~~Predict using OpenAI API calls~~

    1. Predict using an Open Source LLM
    2. Fine-tune an Open Source LLM

### Additional features:

    1. Deploy as a (local) webpage for prettier graphics
    2. Play alongside the model, with the model answers blurred before you finish
    3. Implement a decision tree playing the game alongside you and the LLM, with the answers blurred
