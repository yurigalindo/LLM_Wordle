# LLM Plays Wordle
In this project, an LLM plays the game Wordle.
Currently, basic functionality is working, but the model performs poorly. I am working on prompt engineering to improve the model.

## Roadmap

### Core features
~~Predict using OpenAI API calls~~

    1. Predict using an Open Source LLM
    2. Fine-tune an Open Source LLM

### Additional features:
    1. Deploy as a webpage
    2. Play alongside the model, with the model answers blurred before you finish
